/**
 * Interface for an X.509 extension.
 *
 * <p>The extensions defined for X.509 v3
 * {@link X509Certificate Certificates} and v2
 * {@link X509CRL CRLs} (Certificate Revocation
 * Lists) provide methods
 * for associating additional attributes with users or keys,
 * for managing the certification hierarchy, and for managing CRL
 * distribution. The X.509 extensions format also allows communities
 * to define private extensions to carry information unique to those
 * communities.
 *
 * <p>Each extension in a certificate/CRL may be designated as
 * critical or non-critical.  A certificate/CRL-using system (an application
 * validating a certificate/CRL) must reject the certificate/CRL if it
 * encounters a critical extension it does not recognize.  A non-critical
 * extension may be ignored if it is not recognized.
 * <p>
 * The ASN.1 definition for this is:
 * <pre>
 * Extensions  ::=  SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF Extension
 *
 * Extension  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
 *     extnId        OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
 *     critical      BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
 *     extnValue     OCTET STRING
 *                   -- contains a DER encoding of a value
 *                   -- of the type registered for use with
 *                   -- the extnId object identifier value
 * }
 * </pre>
 * Since not all extensions are known, the {@code getExtensionValue}
 * method returns the DER-encoded OCTET STRING of the
 * extension value (i.e., the {@code extnValue}). This can then
 * be handled by a <em>Class</em> that understands the extension.

/**
 * <p>
 * Abstract class for X.509 certificates. This provides a standard
 * way to access all the attributes of an X.509 certificate.
 * <p>
 * In June of 1996, the basic X.509 v3 format was completed by
 * ISO/IEC and ANSI X9, which is described below in ASN.1:
 * <pre>
 * Certificate  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
 *     tbsCertificate       TBSCertificate,
 *     signatureAlgorithm   AlgorithmIdentifier,
 *     signature            BIT STRING  }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * These certificates are widely used to support authentication and
 * other functionality in Internet security systems. Common applications
 * include Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM), Transport Layer Security (SSL),
 * code signing for trusted software distribution, and Secure Electronic
 * Transactions (SET).
 * <p>
 * These certificates are managed and vouched for by <em>Certificate
 * Authorities</em> (CAs). CAs are services which create certificates by
 * placing data in the X.509 standard format and then digitally signing
 * that data. CAs act as trusted third parties, making introductions
 * between principals who have no direct knowledge of each other.
 * CA certificates are either signed by themselves, or by some other
 * CA such as a "root" CA.
 * <p>
 * More information can be found in
 * <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3280.txt">RFC 3280: Internet X.509
 * Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and CRL Profile</a>.
 * <p>
 * The ASN.1 definition of {@code tbsCertificate} is:
 * <pre>
 * TBSCertificate  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
 *     version         [0]  EXPLICIT Version DEFAULT v1,
 *     serialNumber         CertificateSerialNumber,
 *     signature            AlgorithmIdentifier,
 *     issuer               Name,
 *     validity             Validity,
 *     subject              Name,
 *     subjectPublicKeyInfo SubjectPublicKeyInfo,
 *     issuerUniqueID  [1]  IMPLICIT UniqueIdentifier OPTIONAL,
 *                          -- If present, version must be v2 or v3
 *     subjectUniqueID [2]  IMPLICIT UniqueIdentifier OPTIONAL,
 *                          -- If present, version must be v2 or v3
 *     extensions      [3]  EXPLICIT Extensions OPTIONAL
 *                          -- If present, version must be v3
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Certificates are instantiated using a certificate factory. The following is
 * an example of how to instantiate an X.509 certificate:
 * <pre>
 * try (InputStream inStream = new FileInputStream("fileName-of-cert")) {
 *     CertificateFactory cf = CertificateFactory.getInstance("X.509");
 *     X509Certificate cert = (X509Certificate)cf.generateCertificate(inStream);
 * }
